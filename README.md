# CISP-360
These are all the assignments I completed while enrolled in the CISP 360 course at Folsom Lake College from June 8 - July 31, 2020. This course was an introduction to C++, thus all the code is in C++. See the `ProgramGreeting()` function in each program to see it's purpose.

## Types of assignments
### Homework
The goal of these assignments was to meet the basics requirements of the program and get specifications as stated in the directions. Specifications are denoted with `// Specification ... ` in the code. These were the majority of the grade, so adding features was encouraged. 
### Extra Credit
The goal of these assignments was to simply match the given output using the same inputs. These were meant to be short and quick assignments, so it was not necessary to add extra features.
